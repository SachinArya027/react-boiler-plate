# Boiler Plate for creating React projects

This is my custom version of create-react-app. It includes all the setup and configurations required for webpack, babel, unit tests, linting etc.
This boiler plate can be used to create single-page react applications.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. By default it wil run on port 3000.

### `npm run test`

To run the test cases.

### `npm run test:coverage`

To run the test cases and it will also generate the code coverage report in `coverge` folder.

### `npm run lint`

To check for lint errors.

### `npm run lint:fix`

To run lint and fix potentially fixable lint errors.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
